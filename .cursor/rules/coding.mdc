STRICTLY FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:

- Always use latest TS syntax
- Always use a single tab for indentation
- Always do minimal changes to the codebase to achieve the task
- Always write production-grade code
- Always only write what is needed right now. Keep all your edits as minimal and
  concise as possible to perform a task. Always start by a small research and
  implementation plan, proceed only after confirmation
- Never write your plan when requested to do something, do it right away
- Never write any comments
- Never create .md files unless explicitly requested to
- Never bloat README with too many technical details, keep it concise and simple
- Never use single-letter variables, instead use only descriptive names. This
  applies to all variables including lambda arguments
- Never create relay/empty functions
- Never write "just in case" code which is not necessary (such as extra
  nullifying)
